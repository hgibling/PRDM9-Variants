# PRDM9-Variants
Document all known/described PRDM9 allele and zinc finger variants with standardized names


## Outline
- Compiled lists from literature
  - Berg list
    - Original and updated
  - Ponting list (with error)
  - Hussein list (with repeated names from Berg update)
- NCBI nucleotide search for PRDM9 sequences
  - Remove duplicated sequences
    - Identify discrepancies between Hussein and NCBI
  - Identify known znfs in new sequences
  - Isolate new znf sequences
    - Confirm new znfs not misprints/truncated known znfs

### TODO
- Add ref https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mgg3.56 for Genbank alleles L39-L46
